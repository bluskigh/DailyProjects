# Progress
Not done, yet.
Currently my project is visually not that pleasing, which will be fixed once I finished implementing all the backend functionality.
Backend first, then frontend? No?

## To get running:
Install express and mongoose
```
npm install express
npm install mongoose
```

## Create quizGame database
```
mongo
use quizGame
exit
```

After following steps above it should run.
