# Daily Projects
This repo is used to store all of my "daily" projects that I am working on from now (Feb 21, 2021).
## Why am I doing this?
If im creating a repo saying that I am starting a project, I am obligated to finish it; due to my own belief. 
Also I want to start tracking my projects that I am creating on my free-time :)
## Projects

Quick summary, develop to learn more about Express/Mongoose/EJS. To undersatnd further, Giphy API folder contains a README.
