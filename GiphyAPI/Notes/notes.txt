Session are on the server side.
Cookies are stored in the browser.

Cookies
- have maximum size
- if we had a lot of information we wanted to associate with the users, cookies are not good 
- also not as secure as sessions

Store informatino on the server side, send cookie back to the client

{
  id: 3,
  shoppingCart: [
    {item: "lime", qty: 1}
    {item: "apples", qty: 2}
    {item: "oranges", qty: 1}
  ]
}
{
  id: 4,
  shoppingCart: [
    {item: "lime", qty: 1}
    {item: "apples", qty: 2}
    {item: "oranges", qty: 1}
  ]
}

server -----session id----> client
server is sending back a session id as a cookie (browser stores that)

client-----"I have a cookie for you!" session id is 4-----> server ----> data store ---> returns back relveant information

So all we need to store in the browser, is store a session id (cookie).

Also, not necesarilly the same as the database you're using for your application.... Separate.

Sessions are universal... Example Flask contains session, flask_session
